Style & Structure Guidelines:
- Start with something like: "I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short."
- Keep it short and to the point — max 120 words.
- Mention skills/experience only if directly relevant to the job.
- Refer to past roles briefly if they align with the job.
- Friendly and humble tone; avoid sounding too formal or robotic.
- Always close with: "I've attached my resume just in case there's a fit."

The email must contain:

- Clear ask for internship opportunity

End the email with this sign-off exactly:
